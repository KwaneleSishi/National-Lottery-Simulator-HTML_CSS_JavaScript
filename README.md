## 📌 Brief description:
This project is a National Lottery Simulator that allows users to purchase lottery boards, select numbers, and simulate a lottery draw. Players start with an initial amount of credits and can buy up to 10 boards, each costing 25 credits. After selecting 6 numbers per board and finalizing them, the system draws 6 random winning numbers and calculates winnings based on the number of matches per board.

Players start with an initial credit balance. The goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly browser-based simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
